Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholders, 

It gives me a great honour to address you as the President of Azkoyen and to inform you about the most important events during 2015.

Within a better macroeconomic context, despite some difficult social and political questions in Europe and the market in general, Azkoyen Group continued improving with good results in 2015, showing a net profit of €7.18 million, representing a 94.1% increase on 2014 profit. 
These figures demonstrate that the strategy adopted by the company has been successful, and that we have been able to progress with strength and determination thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of previous years. 

The net consolidated turn over of the Group for 2015 was €126.79 million, an increase of 3.8% over 2014. 

Furthermore, as part of the efforts to place the company on a better financial footing, we reduced net debt by €12.2 million during 2015, ending the year with financial commitments of €15.34 million, 44.2% down on the 2014 closing level. 

I would also like to highlight the streng the ned international presence of Azkoyen throughout this year. 
This is clearly reflected in sales, with 83.3% of the Group's turn over coming from outside Spain, showing the strong and repeated commitment the company has in this regard. 

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the effort you put in every day to build Azkoyen Group. 
This commitment and dedication are absolutely essential for a sustainable, innovative and profitable future for our company. 

Thank you very much for your support and confidence. 

Best regards,

Juan Miguel Sucunza 
Chairman, Azkoyen Board of Directors
