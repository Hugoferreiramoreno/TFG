Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholders,

I am writing to you as Chairman of Azkoyen to re- view the milestones reached in the company over 2014, a year in which the economy has finally shown signs of recovery, after some very tough years in which virtually all businesses were hit hard by the widespread crisis.

In this context, revenues for the Azkoyen Group have experienced an upward shift of 5.7% in 2014. In addition, the company's steady effort to clean up its balance sheet has been reflected in a re- duction of net financial debt of 22.3% in 2014, after being cut by 7.9 million euros, ending at 27.5 million. The policy of containment of spending and debt reduction that we have implemented over the past five years will carry into 2015.

The positive results make it clear that a strong commitment to innovation and international expansion is the right path that will lead to the nec- essary profitability. 
The Group's EBITDA in 2014 was 14.8 million euros, representing an improvement of 19.7% over last year. 
As for the net profit, it comes to 3.7 million euros, that compared to the 92,000 euros profit in the previous year.

I want to emphasize that over 80% of the Group's business is generated outside Spain, reflecting the strong international focus of the company.

Let me take this opportunity to recognize the commitment of each and every one of the people who are part of the Azkoyen Group. 
Their daily effort and dedication have made it possible for us to proudly say we have a company that has come out of the crisis stronger, in far less debt and generating a profit.

Thank you very much, once again, for your trust. 

Sincerely,

Juan Miguel Sucunza
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Azkoyen
